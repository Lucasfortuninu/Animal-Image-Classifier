# Animal-Image-Classifier
Final project for the **Computer Vision** course (3rd year, UPNA). It implements and compares two feature extraction algorithms applied to images of animals, using machine learning models such as SVM, neural networks, and ensemble techniques. The results are analyzed, and the best strategy for classification is determined.
